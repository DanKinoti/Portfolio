     <h3>ABOUT ME!</h3>

           <div class="column">
              <h4>Anime</h4>
              <p>I absolutely love anime. Anime is the japanese version of animation,
              I think anime can leave a great impression or a new sense of feelings once you get into it. With many good quotes and possible lessons behind them, there will be some that you can learn from, some you can implement and some you wished to be in. That sense of feeling is what can make anime fans, otherwise known as weebs or otakus to watch more and more, even though it gives us a new sensation of empty feelings once we watch an anime that touches our hearts, but leaves a scar that makes us feel that we are missing something, once that one good, amazing, thrilling anime you just watched that was your favorite ends. That feeling drives us to watch more and more. Waiting for the next season of quality animeâ€™s to come rolling in.
            One of my favourite anime is Naruto,Akame Ga kill,Asterisk war and many others!</p>
